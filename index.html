        Now in the world of suffering and happiness, falling and rising, weakness and courage or any other emotions take over our lives turn by turn.
         This actually is not new. 
          It is said “In the worldss you have tribulation” (John 16:33).

         On top of living a life of Christianity, being human in general has its ups and downs.
          Being a Christian gives a different perspective in the life of spirituality, so it has far more challenges.
           The Church is always under suffering.
         Even in the world of the Angles has been through countless struggles.
